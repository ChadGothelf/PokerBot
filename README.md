# PokerBot - an autonomous online poker agent

This script was designed by Alexander Ignatiev and Chad Gothelf. It is able to play online poker on the application
PokerStars, without using any of PokerStar's API. By simply analyzing the content of the computer's screen, this program
is able to avoid bot detection software. By running this code on a Raspberry Pi, and utilizing a microcontroller to
simulate mouse movement, one is able to avoid detection from kernel-level anti-cheats.

> We do not condone the use of PokerBot for any commercial purposes, including online cash games or tournaments. This
> project was simply an experiment to see if such a bot was possible to make. For this reason, we are not including any 
> installation manual along with our code.
